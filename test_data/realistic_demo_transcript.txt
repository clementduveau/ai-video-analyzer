 Welcome to this demonstration of our new analytics dashboard. My name is Alex, and today I'll walk you through the key features that make our products stand out. First, let me show you the main dashboard interface. As you can see on the screen, we've redesigned the layout to provide quick access to your most important metrics. The navigation menu on the left gives you one click. Access to Reports, Data Sources, and Settings. Now, let's create a new report. Simply click the plus button in the top right corner. You can select from multiple data sources including SQL databases, REST APIs, or CSV files. For this demo, I'll connect to our sample database. Next, choose your visualization type. We support bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and interactive tables. The system automatically generates a preview as you make selections, which saves significant time. One feature our customers love is the real-time collaboration capability. Team members can leave comments directly on reports, and you'll receive instant notifications when someone mentions you. This has reduced email. Back and forth by approximately 40% in our internal testing. Let me highlight the performance improvements. Report generation now takes just three seconds on average compared to 15 seconds in the previous version. We've also added automatic data caching. So frequently accessed, reports load almost instantly. Finally, I want to demonstrate our new export functionality. You can now export reports to PDF, Excel, or PowerPoint with a single click. The formatting is preserved, and you can even schedule automated exports to run daily or weekly. In summary, our analytics dashboard provides faster performance, better collaboration, and more flexible export options. These improvements directly address the top three feature requests from our customer base. Thank you for watching this demonstration.
