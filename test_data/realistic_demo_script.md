## Original Demo Script

Welcome to this demonstration of our new analytics dashboard.
My name is Alex, and today I'll walk you through the key features
that make our product stand out.

First, let me show you the main dashboard interface. As you can see on
the screen, we've redesigned the layout to provide quick access to your
most important metrics. The navigation menu on the left gives you one-click
access to reports, data sources, and settings.

Now, let's create a new report. Simply click the plus button in the
top right corner. You can select from multiple data sources including
SQL databases, REST APIs, or CSV files. For this demo, I'll connect
to our sample database.

Next, choose your visualization type. We support bar charts, line graphs,
pie charts, and interactive tables. The system automatically generates
a preview as you make selections, which saves significant time.

One feature our customers love is the real-time collaboration capability.
Team members can leave comments directly on reports, and you'll receive
instant notifications when someone mentions you. This has reduced email
back-and-forth by approximately forty percent in our internal testing.

Let me highlight the performance improvements. Report generation now takes
just three seconds on average, compared to fifteen seconds in the previous
version. We've also added automatic data caching, so frequently accessed
reports load almost instantly.

Finally, I want to demonstrate our new export functionality. You can now
export reports to PDF, Excel, or PowerPoint with a single click. The
formatting is preserved, and you can even schedule automated exports to
run daily or weekly.

In summary, our analytics dashboard provides faster performance, better
collaboration, and more flexible export options. These improvements
directly address the top three feature requests from our customer base.

Thank you for watching this demonstration. If you have any questions,
please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.

## Usage

This script is hard-coded in `create_sample_demo_audio.py` as the `DEMO_SCRIPT` variable.

To customize, edit that variable:

```python
DEMO_SCRIPT = """
Your custom demo script here...
"""
```

Then regenerate the audio:

```bash
python create_sample_demo_audio.py
```
